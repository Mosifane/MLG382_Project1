### where to start
-  run the decision_tree.py
-  random_forest.py
   to train and store models.
# run the make_prediction.py to view the resulting predictions made on the validation.csv data under src.

### What was done
- Exploratory Data Analysis,
- data preproccessing and cleaning,
- Data transformation,
- Decision tree ml model,
- Random Forest ml model,
- feature engineering,
- storage of both models in .pk files,
- final predictions on validation.csv.
